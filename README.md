# Minecraft ballistics

A cool little project that aims to create tools that allow to calculate data regarding minecraft arrow trajectories, while also using as many programming languages as possible.

## Tools

So far only two tools have been produced:

- consoleCalculator - A console utility that acts as a rudimentary minecraft ballistics calculator
- guiCalculator - a gui version of console calculator that also visualizes the trajectory

## Compilation

As of right now the tools utilize three different programming languages (Fortran 90, C, C++).
Just run

```sh
make requirements
make all
```

To install all necessary requirements on your system and compile everything.
