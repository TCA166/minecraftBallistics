/* 
this is all terrible
but I guess I do owe an explanation. Obj C as D or C++ stores internally methods as functions with mangled names.
Unfortunately this scheme is not compatible with C, so I have to use extern "C" to avoid name mangling.
I also have to provide the two SECRET APPLEâ„¢ arguments to the functions, which are the object (equivalent to this or self)
and the command (equivalent to the method name). Apparently command can be also a message? and you can do cool things with it.
No clue tho I would look it up in the standard IF THERE WAS ONE.
